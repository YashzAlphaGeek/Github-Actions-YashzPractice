# Github-Examples

A repository containing GitHub Actions examples for programmatic use.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository includes the following GitHub Actions workflows located in the `.github/workflows` directory:

### 1. [`greetings.yml`](https://github.com/YashzAlphaGeek/Github-Examples-YashzPractice/blob/main/.github/workflows/greetings.yml)
- **Purpose**: This workflow sends a greeting message whenever a new issue or pull request is created. Itâ€™s a simple way to automate a welcoming response to contributors.
- **Trigger**: Activated automatically on the creation of issues or pull requests.

### 2. **[`manualeventtrigger.yml`](https://github.com/YashzAlphaGeek/Github-Examples-YashzPractice/blob/main/.github/workflows/manualeventtrigger.yml)**:
   - **Purpose**: This workflow allows you to manually trigger actions in the repository. It's useful for workflows that need to be run on demand rather than automatically.
   - **Trigger**: This workflow is triggered manually through the GitHub Actions interface.

### 3. **[`multi-event.yml`](https://github.com/YashzAlphaGeek/Github-Examples-YashzPractice/blob/main/.github/workflows/multi-event.yml)**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles multiple events, such as push and pull requests, to perform tasks like testing or deployment across different branches or event types.
   - **Trigger**: Runs on multiple events including pushes to the repository and pull request actions.
     
### 4. **[`schedule_two_min.yml`](https://github.com/YashzAlphaGeek/Github-Examples-YashzPractice/blob/main/.github/workflows/schedule_two_min.yml)**:
   - **Purpose**: This workflow is scheduled to run every two minutes, allowing for regular checks, updates, or automated tasks that need frequent execution.
   - **Trigger**: Triggered by a cron schedule every two minutes.
  
Each of these workflows is defined in its respective YAML file, which can be navigated directly via the provided links.
